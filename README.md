## Notebook webcams

Once upon a time one of my friends ran a notebook repair business.

Over the years he collected many-many covers including webcams.

At one day we sat down and tested a couple of them to see which could be repurposed for robotics competitions.

At that time we were mainly curious about the MJPEG support of the cameras.
